### Bedrock 5 will be released on the 30th of September, [click here for the upcoming webinar](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/f7564ab5-78aa-4c30-a93f-b880451f2de2@0635d657-0279-4110-9c8f-2ee27b1e065b).

### This next-generation release of Bedrock has been refactored and tested to support IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+. Bedrock 5 does not support earlier versions of the TM1 Database. These versions are supported by [Bedrock 4](https://github.com/cubewise-code/bedrock)

<b>Bedrock 5</b> is the latest evolution of the Bedrock library, specifically updated for compatibility with IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+. This release reflects the ongoing commitment to maintaining best practices for IBM Planning Analytics development, providing optimized, standardized, and scalable TurboIntegrator (TI) code assets that align with changes introduced in the IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.

## What is Bedrock?

Bedrock is a community-driven IBM Planning Analytics best practice framework. It provides modular, reusable TI processes, tools, documentation, and training resources designed to:

- Accelerate model development
- Increase maintainability
- Improve auditability
- Reduce administration and support overhead

The Bedrock library is built on years of global IBM Planning Analytics implementation experience and is widely adopted in complex, enterprise-level IBM Planning Analytics environments.

## What's New in Bedrock 5?

Bedrock 5 brings targeted updates to support IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+, including:

- <b>Compatibility Fixes</b>: Adjustments for updated IBM Planning Analytics system behavior and function changes.
- <b>Deprecated Functions</b>: Clear documentation of processes no longer required or supported in the latest version of IBM Planning Analytics.
- <b>Modified Processes</b>: Existing processes updated to maintain their original functionality while aligning with new IBM Planning Analytics features and syntax.
- <b>Updated Installation Guide</b>: Step-by-step instructions for deploying Bedrock 5 into your IBM Planning Analytics environment.

Note: Bedrock 5 is intended only for the IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+. For TM1 11.x or IBM Planning Analytics 2.0.x, use [Bedrock 4](https://github.com/cubewise-code/bedrock)

## Why Bedrock?

With growing IBM Planning Analytics adoption, standardization is critical. Bedrock provides:

- A standardized TI codebase for reuse across models and teams.
- Faster development cycles through proven, modular processes.
- Lower learning curve for new developers.
- Reduced black-box risk through increased transparency and logging.
- Improved scalability to handle complex business models with large datasets and high concurrency.
