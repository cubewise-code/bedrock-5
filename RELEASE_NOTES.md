# Bedrock 5.0.0 Release Notes

## Release Date: September 30, 2024

## Overview

Bedrock 5 is a major release specifically designed for IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+. This release addresses compatibility issues arising from deprecated TM1 functions while maintaining the full functionality of the Bedrock library.

## Breaking Changes

### Minimum Version Requirement

- **Required**: IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4 or higher
- **Not Compatible**: TM1 11.x or Planning Analytics 2.0.x (use Bedrock 4 for these versions)

### Deprecated Processes

IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12 has several deprecated functions when compared to the earlier versions of the TM1 Database. Because of this, the following Bedrock processes have now been deprecated:
| Bedrock Process | TM1 Deprecated Function |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `}bedrock.cube.data.save` | `CubeSaveData` |
| `}bedrock.dim.attr.swapalias` | `SwapAliasWithPrincipalName` |
| `}bedrock.hier.create.fromrollup.aliasswap` | `SwapAliasWithPrincipalName` |
| `}bedrock.security.client.password.reset` | `AssignClientPassword` |
| `}bedrock.server.dir.backup` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.dir.listcontents` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.encrypt.directory` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.encrypt.file` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.executecommand` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.logfile.delete` | `ExecuteCommand` |
| `}bedrock.server.savedataall` | `SaveDataAll` |

## Modified Functions

### Summary of Changes

Due to the deprecation of the above functions in the IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12, the following Bedrock processes have been modified to ensure compatibility with the IBM Planning Analytics TM1 Database 12.4+. **The functionality of these processes has not changed.**

Changes in the Bedrock processes were primarily due to:

- Deprecation of `CubeSetLogChanges`.
- Inability to access the `.rux` file.
- Deprecation of `ExecuteCommand` when used to delete a file (replaced with `ASCIIDelete`).
- Deprecation of the `}DimensionProperties` cube.
- Deprecation of `AssignClientPassword`.
- Deprecation of the `}ApplicationSecurity` cube.
